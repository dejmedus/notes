- `cat file*` displays files with names starting with file
- `cat < -` adding < before filename allows you to access files named with special chars
- `cat “filename w spaces”` adding quotation marks allows you to access files with spaces in the name

- `cat file1 file2` displays multiple files content in cli
- `cat file1 file2 > newcombinedfile` creates a new combined file
- `cat < file1 > file2` copies file1 to file2
- `cat filename | fmt -w 20` fmt—format. -w width. Display file content with width of 20 chars
- `cat -n filename` prints line numbers

#### Find, sort, and search files

- `find . -name src -type d` find directory with name src
- `find . -path  "*/folderName/*.py" -type f` find all of type files that have a in a folder
- `du fileName -c` estimate file size in bytes
- `sort filename` sorts lines of a file alphabetically
- `sort filename | uniq -c` sort lines, output duplicate lines only once, -c will count lines
- `sort filename | uniq -u` return only unique lines
- `wc filename` outputs how many lines, words, and characters are in a file
- `grep pattern filename` looks for text inside files. eg. grep admin /desktop/folder
- `grep -B 0 -A 5 "searchWord" filename` return the line with the search word and x lines before (-B) and x lines after
- `grep -C 2 foo README.txt` return the line and the same amount of lines before and after
- `grep -f file1 file2` compares and returns similar lines
- `grep "YOUR SEARCH STRING" filename > output-file` copies (> means redirect) grep results into output-file
- `grep -i pattern filename` ignores word case
- `grep -r pattern filename` searches all files under the specified directory
- `egrep "condition" filename` (grep -E) output lines containing condition. eg. **egrep "practice|PRACTICE" filename** returns all lines containing the word practice
- `fgrep "condition" filename` (grep -F) find the exact string "condition" in file

#### Compare, rename, and manipulate files

- `ls -v | cat -n | while read n f; do mv -n "$f" "$n.ext"; done` renames all files in directory with incrementing numbers
- `diff file1 file2` compares differences between files
- `sed -n 5p file` print one line of file
- `sed "word" file` removes the word from file

- `kill -3 PID` QUIT the process at process id
- `killall processName` ends all processes with name

#### DNS/IP

- `whois domainname` Domain name system lookup
- `nslookup websitename.com` lookup Internet Protocol address http://142.251.215.238:80 Google.com

### HTTP request

<Star text="curl stands for client URL" />

- `-H` headers
- `-X` request
- `-d` data

```
  curl -H "X-Internal-Challenge: secret-key" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:3000/ -d '{"payload"{"url":"https://demo.appwrite.io/","method":"GET","headers":{"x-client-version":"1.0.0"},"body":""}}'
```

### Unix file permissions

- `chown` change owner
- `chown -options userName:groupName filename`
- `chmod` change mode, allows users to change the read, write, and execute permissions for files and folders
- `ls -l filename` view info returns permissions

| symbol | filetype  |     | mode |         |     |
| ------ | --------- | --- | ---- | ------- | --- |
| -      | file      |     | r    | read    | 4   |
| d      | directory |     | w    | write   | 2   |
| i      | link      |     | x    | execute | 1   |

**Example:** `-rw-r--r--@` **-** regular filetype, **rw-** user can read and write, **r—** groups and others can only read

#### Types of users:

- **User** Person who has created the file.
- **Group** Group of other users who share similar privileges as that of the owner.
- **Others** Other members who have access to the path where you have kept the files.

#### Permission level options:

- 4 Read Permission
- 2 Write Permission
- 1 Execute Permission
- 0 No permission

**Calculated** (user read + user write + user execute)(group read + group write…)(others…)

```shell
# full permission for all
chmod 777 filename.txt
# USER: 4+2+1 = 7 GROUP: 4+2 = 6 OTHERS: 0
# USER: read, write, execute GROUP: read, write OTHERS: none.
chmod 760 filename.txt

```

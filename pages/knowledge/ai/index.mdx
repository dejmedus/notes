## Machine Learning

The science of getting computers to act without explicitly programmed. Machines learn based on data.

### Supervised learning

Learning to predict or classify labels based on labelled input data. Copy the same pattern.

Once you have a model you can:

- Evaluate with the test dataset and see how well the model preforms
- Predict based on unseen real world data

#### k-nearest neighbors algorithm

check the k instances in the training data that are closest to your new instance

Classification: categorical labels - choose the majority of values
Regression: continuous labels - choose the mean/median of those values

#### Linear Regression

When you have a x and a y, we want to find the (straight) line between them.

Trying to achieve the smallest mean squared error between the prediction and ground proof (data and the line)

Could also be a polynomial fitting (not straight line)

Underfitting - too straight
Overfitting - too squiggly

We want this to follow the _general_ shape of the data

As the model gets better, the training accuracy will go up and the testing accuracy will go down.

Cross-validation prevents overfitting. Split the training set into training and validation (to measure RSS).

Classification: logistic Regression

Other supervised classifiers:

- decision tree
- support vector machines (separates things with the most space)
- naive bayes (probabilities)
- neural network (computation-heavy)

### Unsupervised learning

Finding patterns and commonalities in unlabeled data. Group data.

Flat clustoring algorithm

- iteratively refine
  Hierarchial
- tree structure

K-means the most popular clustering algorithm

- usually a baseline
- randomly assign, and then iteratively tweak for accuracy
- it doesn't like outliers (can mess up the cluster centers)

Hierarchial clustering

- produces nested clusters organized in a tree
- visualized as a dendogram?

### Reinforcement

Learning well-performing behavior from state observations and rewards.

You want to balance exploitation (use knowledge you already have) and exploration (take a chance on actions, even if you don't already know they perform well)

### Data Types

- Continuous
- Discrete
- Categorical

  - Binary
  - Ordinal

- Tabular (rows and cols)
- Time series (time/order of data)
- Graph/Network
- Images
- Language / text

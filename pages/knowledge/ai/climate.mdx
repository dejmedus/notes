## AI in Climate Action

### Axis of Action

- Climate science: understanding and predicting climate change
- Mitigation: reducing or preventing greenhouse gas emissions
- Adaptation: responding to the effects of a changing climate
  - measuring and predicting risks
  - strengthening adaptive capacity
    - robustness: withstanding a range of outcomes
    - resilience: recovery after impact

### Frameworks

- Climate justice: an equity-centered approach to climate change
- Co-benefits: a holistic approach. Considering linkages between climate change and other sustainable development goals

### How can ML help advance climate action?

1. Distilling raw data into actionable information

- Computer vision, NLP
- Examples: mapping deforestation and carbon stock, data on building footprints, evaluating coastal flood risks, parsing corporate climate-relevant disclosures

2. Optimizing complex systems

- Optimization, control, reinforcement learning
- Examples: optimizing heat/cooling, rail and transport, electrical grid responses

3. Improving predictions and forecasts

- Time series analysis, computer vision, bayesian methods
- Examples: forecasting solar/wind power output, electricity demand, crop yield

4. Accelerating scientific discover

- generative models, active learning, reinforcement learning, graph neural networks
- Examples: identify candidate materials, algorithms for fusion reactors

5. Accelerating time-intensive simulations

- physics-informed ML, computer vision, interpretableML, casual ML
- Examples: superresolution of predictions from climate models,simulating car aerodynamics, speed up planning models for electrical grids

### Framework to evaluate ML applications

- Is ML needed?
- What is the scope?
- What is the time horizon (immediacy of impact)
- Likelihood that a solution can be found
- Feasibility to be deployed
- Potential side effects

### Key considerations

- ML is not always relevant
- High-impact applications are often not "flashy"
- Sophisticated algorithms are not always required
- Requires interdisciplinary collaboration
- Equitability: empower stakeholders

### Path to impact

> "It's important to understand how your ML algorithm is situated within its broader pathway to impact" - Priya Donti

#### Data and metrics

Domain identification => project scoping => development => analysis

Data sets: collection, annotation, collation, inference, and/or licensing
Evaluation metrics: requires involvement from stakeholders

üîó

CCAI dataset wishlist
Lacuna fund for climate datasets
NeurIPS published datasets

#### Responsible AI

- Mitigating biases in data and models, ensure we don't replicate historic biases
- Trustworthiness and accountability
- Centering equity and climate justice
- Access/benefit is democratized
- Avoiding digital colonialism: don't take/use data from communities that will not get any benefit from/stake in the project. Or exploiting privacy regulations.

#### Stakeholder engagement

Stakeholders may include researchers, industry, users, policymakers, communities.

### MLs impact

#### MLs carbon footprints

- Computation and hardware
  - operational emissions: energy consumed during computation. Can be addressed with more efficient hardware, better cooling, or re-use of waste heat. Also, renewable energy.
- System-level impact

Framework for evaluation
Computation: Measure, reduce where possible
Application: Quantify and evaluate, be transparent with stakeholders (be careful with "greenwashing")

## Intro to Climate Change.

Kamal Kapadia - Terra.do

- Risks of adverse effects of climate change will increase above 1.5C of global warming.

> "There is **no** substitute for mitigation (reducing emissions/achieving net zero)"

- Warming will only stop at zero or net-zero emissions
- cross-cutting levers:
  - politics & activism
  - policies
  - laws & regulation
  - finance
  - corporate sustainability
  - communications
  - education
- We need to center climate justice in the climate change convo

### What is machine learning

The science of getting computers to act without explicitly programmed. Machines learn based on data.

### Supervised learning

Learning to predict or classify labels based on labelled input data. Copy the same pattern.

Once you have a model you can:

- Evaluate with the test dataset and see how well the model preforms
- Predict based on unseen real world data

#### k-nearest neighbours algorithm

check the k instances in the training data that are closest to your new instance

Classification: categorical labels - choose the majority of values
Regression: continuous labels - choose the mean/median of those values

#### Linear Regression

When you have a x and a y, we want to find the (straight) line between them.

Trying to achieve the smallest mean squared error between the prediction and ground proof (data and the line)

Could also be a polynomial fitting (not straight line)

Underfitting - too straight
Overfitting - too squiggly

We want this to follow the _general_ shape of the data

As the model gets better, the training accuracy will go up and the testing accuracy will go down.

Cross-validation prevents overfitting. Split the training set into training and validation (to measure RSS).

Classification: logistic Regression

Other supervised classifiers:

- decision tree
- support vector machines (separates things with the most space)
- naive bayes (probabilities)
- neural network (computation-heavy)

‚≠ê Do not re-implement these algorithms yourself

üî®

- scikit-learn
- pytorch
- tensorflow

### Unsupervised learning

Finding patterns and commonalities in unlabeled data. Group data.

Flat clustoring algorithm

- iteratively refine
  Hierarchial
- tree structure

K-means the most popular clustering algorithm

- usually a baseline
- randomly assign, and then iteratively tweak for accuracy
- it doesn't like outliers (can mess up the cluster centers)

Hierarchial clustering

- produces nested clusters organized in a tree
- visualized as a dendogram?

### Reinforcement

Learning well-performing behavior from state observations and rewards.

You want to balance exploitation (use knowledge you already have) and exploration (take a chance on actions, even if you don't already know they perform well)

### Data Types

- Continuous
- Discrete
- Categorical

  - Binary
  - Ordinal

- Tabular (rows and cols)
- Time series (time/order of data)
- Graph/Network
- Images
- Language / text

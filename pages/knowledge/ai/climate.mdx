## AI in Climate Action

### Axis of Action

- Knowledge Building: understanding and predicting climate change
- Mitigation: reducing or preventing greenhouse gas emissions
- Adaptation: responding to the effects of a changing climate
  - measuring and predicting risks
  - strengthening adaptive capacity
    - robustness: withstanding a range of outcomes
    - resilience: recovery after impact

    ["NeurIPS published datasets", "google.com"],

### Frameworks

- Climate justice: an equity-centered approach to climate change
- Co-benefits: a holistic approach. Considering linkages between climate change and other sustainable development goals

### How can ML help advance climate action?

1. Distilling raw data into actionable information

- Computer vision, NLP
- Examples: mapping deforestation and carbon stock, data on building footprints, evaluating coastal flood risks, parsing corporate climate-relevant disclosures

2. Optimizing complex systems

- Optimization, control, reinforcement learning
- Examples: optimizing heat/cooling, rail and transport, electrical grid responses

3. Improving predictions and forecasts

- Time series analysis, computer vision, bayesian methods
- Examples: forecasting solar/wind power output, electricity demand, crop yield

4. Accelerating scientific discover

- generative models, active learning, reinforcement learning, graph neural networks
- Examples: identify candidate materials, algorithms for fusion reactors

5. Accelerating time-intensive simulations

- physics-informed ML, computer vision, interpretableML, casual ML
- Examples: superresolution of predictions from climate models,simulating car aerodynamics, speed up planning models for electrical grids

### Framework to evaluate ML applications

- Is ML needed?
- What is the scope?
- What is the time horizon (immediacy of impact)
- Likelihood that a solution can be found
- Feasibility to be deployed
- Potential side effects

### Key considerations

- ML is not always relevant
- High-impact applications are often not "flashy"
- Sophisticated algorithms are not always required
- Requires interdisciplinary collaboration
- Equitability: empower stakeholders

### Path to impact

#### Data and metrics

<Star text="Domain identification => project scoping => development => analysis" />

Data sets: collection, annotation, collation, inference, and/or licensing
Evaluation metrics: requires involvement from stakeholders

<Tools
  list={[
    ["CCAI dataset wishlist", "google.com"],
    ["Lacuna fund for climate datasets", "google.com"],
    ["NeurIPS published datasets", "google.com"],
  ]}
/>

#### Responsible AI

- Mitigating biases in data and models, ensure we don't replicate historic biases
- Trustworthiness and accountability
- Centering equity and climate justice
- Access/benefit is democratized
- Avoiding digital colonialism: don't take/use data from communities that will not get any benefit from/stake in the project. Or exploiting privacy regulations.

#### Stakeholder engagement

Stakeholders may include researchers, industry, users, policymakers, communities.

### MLs impact

#### MLs carbon footprints

- Computation and hardware
  - operational emissions: energy consumed during computation. Can be addressed with more efficient hardware, better cooling, or re-use of waste heat. Also, renewable energy.
- System-level impact

Framework for evaluation
Computation: Measure, reduce where possible
Application: Quantify and evaluate, be transparent with stakeholders (be careful with "greenwashing")

## Intro to Climate Change.

- Risks of adverse effects of climate change will increase above 1.5C of global warming.

> "There is **no** substitute for mitigation (reducing emissions/achieving net zero)"

- Warming will only stop at zero or net-zero emissions
- cross-cutting levers:
  - politics & activism
  - policies
  - laws & regulation
  - finance
  - corporate sustainability
  - communications
  - education
- We need to center climate justice in the climate change convo
